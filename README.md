# Aurora Research OS

Aurora Research OS is an AI-assisted "Research-in-a-Box" platform that helps clinicians turn real-world ideas into a coherent, standards-aligned **baseline draft package** (protocol, SAP, CRFs, PIS/ICF, ethics & CTRI mapping) plus a live eCRF workspace — without claiming regulatory approval. 

Version 1 is focused on India and aligns with ICMR ethics guidelines, CTRI dataset structure, Indian GCP/NDCT principles, and ICH E6(R3) expectations, using strict guardrails and full auditability.
